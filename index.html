        <p class="description">Airplanes are fixed-wing aircraft that are propelled through the air by engines. They are
            used for transportation, recreation, research and military purposes. Engines provide the thrust needed to
            move a plane forward, overcoming drag and allowing the wings to create lift.</p>
